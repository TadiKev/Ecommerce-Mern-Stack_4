# MERN Stack Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with the frontend powered by React Vite for faster development and build processes.

## Features

- **Frontend**: React Vite for a streamlined development experience.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API creation.
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.
- CRUD operations for managing data.
- State management using Redux Toolkit (if applicable).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB set up locally or a cloud MongoDB Atlas instance.
- Git for version control.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <Ecommerce-Mern-Stack_4>

##Install backend dependencies:
cd backend
npm install

##Install frontend dependencies:
cd ../frontend
npm install

PORT=5000
DB_URL='mongodb+srv://EcomDeveloper:EcomDeveloper123@clothesecommerce.gkef3.mongodb.net/clothesEcom?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
JWT_SECRET_KEY="2ab8b77d1793de3e957321fe03f743614902ea89e4b05a84cc2105189701d4fb2872feaf69b73690a1cf9a58895714b263bb70cf55e64f42dabf269a0a5ead8d"

##Start the backend server:
cd backend
npm start

##Start the frontend development server:
cd frontend
npm run dev

##Access the Application
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:5000

##Future Plans
Deployment on a hosting platform for both the frontend and backend.
Adding more advanced features, such as payment integration and real-time updates.
Implementing additional pages, components, and optimizations for a better user experience.


### Key Adjustments Made:
1. Clearly defined sections: **Installation**, **Environment Variables**, and **Steps to Run the Project**.
2. Fixed formatting for code blocks to make the instructions easier to follow.
3. Added hyperlinks for accessing the application locally.
4. Cleaned up redundant markers like `##Install` and properly sectioned the steps for clarity.
